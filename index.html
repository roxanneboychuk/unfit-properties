<h1>Syracuse unfit properties trace back to lead exposure</h1>

<h2>Syracuse zip codes with high rates of lead poisoning also have high numbers of unfit properties</h2>

<p>Lead contamination could be a main contributor to Syracuse properties being deemed unfit. About <a href= "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/syracuse-residents-activists-demand-action-lead-water-rcna180390#">26%</a> of Syracuse homes exceed federal lead levels, according to a sample from the Environmental Protection Agency. Lead exposure <a href= "https://nchh.org/resource-library/Lead_Safe_Housing_Policy_Guidance.pdf">falls under</a> the category of property maintenance. Over half of Syracuse' unfit properties had internal property maintenance issues.</p>
 
<p>The unfit property data sample ranges from Jan. 27, 2014 to Sept. 12, 2024. According to the data, 262 unfit property complaints were filed in Syracuse over the last decade. Also in recent years, Syracuse’s lead poisoning cases have steadily increased to one of the highest rates in the country, <a href= "https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/groups-seek-action-on-syracuse-lead-contaminated-drinking-water.pdf">according to</a> the National Resources Defense Council.</p>

<p>About a month ago, the NRDC drafted a <a href= "https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/groups-seek-action-on-syracuse-lead-contaminated-drinking-water.pdf">letter</a> to the city of Syracuse demanding that they address the record-high lead poisoning rates in the city. More than <a href= "https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/syracuse-ny-lead-in-water/">14,000</a> homes in Syracuse are exposed to lead, according to the NRDC.</p>
 
<p>Syracuse area codes 13204, 13205 and 13208 have both high property maintenance 
<a href= "https://data-syr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/71525e1b176e4fcba2edee8c6a590f84">complaints</a> as well as high child lead poisoning <a href= "http://www.ongov.net/health/lead/placeandracedata.html">rates</a>, according to ongov.net and syr.gov. Out of all the property maintenance complaints, 44 of them are in the zip code 13204, the most out of all area codes in Syracuse. In that zip code, 65 children tested positive for lead in their blood.</p>

<p>Debra Lewis, lead program coordinator for the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program and Healthy Homes Initiative for Onondaga County Health Department, said part of preventing children from being exposed to lead is conducting home inspections.</p>
 
<p>“The way that a health department does a home inspection is different than other kinds of housing inspections. For us, it constitutes an exposure investigation,” Lewis said. “It's rare for us to find other sources that lead to a child having an elevated lead level.”</p>
 
<p>In Onondaga County, landlords and contractors are responsible for providing a tenant with information about identifying and controlling hazards in properties built before 1978, <a href= "http://www.ongov.net/health/lead/tenants.html">according to</a> ongov.net. Lewis said that because of this rental requirement, she “hopes” that the owner will have gone through the process of inspecting the property before a tenant moves in, but that she and her team are in no way of knowing or controlling this.</p>
 
<p>Even with the inspection requirement, most properties claimed “unfit” in Syracuse were due to property maintenance issues. With the data correlation, lead poisoning could be a main part of property maintenance issues in Syracuse, which is very dangerous for children living in these properties and puts their health at risk.</p>
 
<p>“There really is no treatment,” Lewis said. “The treatment is to remove the source of exposure from the child's environment.”</p>

<p>Dr. Travis Hobart, a pediatrician at SUNY Upstate Medical University, said removing the source of exposure can be challenging because lead is not only in individual properties anymore, it is now in the water source itself.</p>

<p>Hobart said old city lead pipes are corroded by the water, therefore leaking lead into the water that people drink. This exposes numerous properties around Syracuse to lead because the origin of the source is not as clear-cut. He said this causes more problems for doctors because it’s difficult for them to grasp the scope of the issue and the people it affects for treatment.</p>

<p>“The population at highest risk is really one and two-year-olds, where we're testing them and we're screening them, and we're trying to address it. With the water contamination, the people at highest risk are the infants, the newborns that are drinking water in their formula, that have water formula mixed from tainted water,” Hobart said.</p> 

<p>Hobart also said the range of houses that are tested for lead are probably much lower than the number of houses contaminated with it. He said testing is usually limited to around 100 houses, and that more testing would likely reveal more houses with exposure.</p> 

<p>He said the different patients he treats for lead poisoning come from a lot of the same neighborhoods where old houses and poverty is most prominent. Hobart said mitigating the issue is difficult because families either cannot afford to remove the source or they don’t have the resources to hold their landlords accountable. </p>

<p>“In public housing, there's no more lead paint because the public housing has enforced that nobody's using lead paint,” Hobart said. “In private housing that's rented by a landlord, there's a lot more barriers for people trying to get lead paint out to actually make the individual landlords do anything.”</p>

<p>Another issue these communities face is having little access to resources for treating lead poisoning. To address the problem of home lead contamination, Hobart said the city needs to do extensive outreach to those areas to provide the accessibility and treatment they need. He also said attacking these issues at their source – either in the paint or pipes – will be the best way to terminate the issue, and faster at the pace at which it’s going.</p> 

<p>“The city is working to replace all the lead service lines,” Hobart said. “I think we could go faster than 10 years if we wanted, hopefully we do.”</p>
